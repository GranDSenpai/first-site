    My website (this XD)

Created this website with a lot of help from GPT-4, although it wrote the bulk of the code, I'm still learning a lot about the syntax and overall structure of HTML coding in general. My current plan is to build upon this website using all of the new things that I learn and commit those things I've learnt to memory. I can imagine that sometime in the future I will have to rewrite this entire website because the code strcture will be messy since I've just started learning how to code, but we'll get there once we get there.
